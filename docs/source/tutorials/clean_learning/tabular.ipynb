Tabular (or *structured*) data are typically organized in a row/column format and stored in a SQL database or file types like: CSV, Excel, or Parquet. Here we consider a Student Grades dataset, which contains over 900 individuals who have three exam grades and some optional notes, each being assigned a letter grade (their class label). cleanlab automatically identifies _hundreds_ of examples in this dataset that were mislabeled with the incorrect final grade (data entry mistakes). \n",
