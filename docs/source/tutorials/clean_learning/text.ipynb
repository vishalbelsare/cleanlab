We consider a subset of the [Banking77-OOS Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04564) containing 1,000 customer service requests which can be classified into 10 categories corresponding to the intent of the request. cleanlab will shortlist examples that confuse our ML model the most; many of which are potential label errors, out-of-scope examples, or otherwise ambiguous examples. cleanlab's `CleanLearning` class automatically detects and filters out such badly labeled data, in order to train a more robust version of any Machine Learning model.
