    "This 5-minute quickstart tutorial uses cleanlab to find potentially incorrect numeric values in a dataset column by means of a regression model. Unlike classification models, regression predicts numeric quantities such as price, income, age,... Response values in regression datasets may be corrupted due to: data entry or measurement errors, noise from sensors or other processes, or broken data pipelines. To find corrupted values in a numeric column, we treat it as the target value, i.e. label, to be predicted by a regression model and then use cleanlab to decide when the model predictions are trustworthy while deviating from the observed label value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we consider a student grades dataset, which records three exam grades and some optional notes for over 900 students, each being assigned a final score. Combined with any regression model of your choosing, cleanlab automatically identifies examples in this dataset that have incorrect final scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview of what weâ€™ll do in this tutorial:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fit a simple Gradient Boosting model (any other model could be used) on the exam-score and notes (covariates) in order to compute out-of-sample predictions of the final grade (the response variable in our regression).\n",
    "- Use cleanlab's `CleanLearning.find_label_issues()` method to identify potentially incorrect final grade values based on outputs from this regression model.\n",
    "- Train a more robust version of the same model after dropping the identified label errors using CleanLearning.\n",
    "- Run an alternative workflow to detect errors via cleanlab's `Datalab` audit, which can simultaneously estimate **many other types of data issues**."

Alternatively, if you don't have a sklearn-compatible regression model or already have pre-computed predictions from the model you'd like to rely on, you can pass these predictions into `Datalab` directly to find issues based on them instead of providing a regression model."
