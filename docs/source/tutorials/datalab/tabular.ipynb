    "In this 5-minute quickstart tutorial, we use Datalab to detect various issues in a classification dataset with tabular (numeric/categorical) features. Tabular (or *structured*) data are typically organized in a row/column format and stored in a SQL database or file types like: CSV, Excel, or Parquet. Here we consider a Student Grades dataset, which contains over 900 individuals who have three exam grades and some optional notes, each being assigned a letter grade (their class label). cleanlab automatically identifies _hundreds_ of examples in this dataset that were mislabeled with the incorrect final grade selected. You can run the same code from this tutorial to detect incorrect information in your own tabular classification datasets.\n",
