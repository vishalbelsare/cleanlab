These lower-level methods only work with integer-encoded labels in the range `{0,1, ... K-1}` where `K = number_of_classes`. The `labels` array should only contain integer values in the range  `{0, K-1}` and be of shape `(N,)` where `N = total_number_of_data_points`.\n",

    "1. Use cleanlab to find label issues in your test data as well (we recommend pooling `labels` across both training and test data into one input for `find_label_issues()`). Then manually review and fix label issues identified in the test data to verify accuracy measurements are actually meaningful.\n",

    "3. Try to find a better model (eg. via hyperparameter tuning or changing to another classifier). `CleanLearning` can find better label issues by leveraging a better model, which allows it to produce better quality training data. This can form a virtuous cycle in which better models -> better issue detection -> better data -> even better models! \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Does your dataset have a *junk* (or *clutter*, *unknown*, *other*) class? If you have bad data, consider creating one (c.f. Caltech-256).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Consider merging similar/overlapping classes found via ``cleanlab.dataset.find_overlapping_classes``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other general tips to improve label error detection performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try creating more restrictive new filters by combining their intersections (e.g. `combined_boolean_mask = mask1 & mask2` where `mask1` and `mask2` are the boolean masks created by running `find_label_issues` with different values of the `filter_by` argument).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If your `pred_probs` are obtained via a neural network, try averaging the `pred_probs` over the last K epochs of training instead of just using the final `pred_probs`. Similarly, you can try averaging `pred_probs` from several models (remember to re-normalize) or using ``cleanlab.rank.get_label_quality_ensemble_scores``.\n"

[Cleanlab Studio](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/data-centric-ai/) is a no-code platform to **find and fix** problems in real-world ML datasets. Cleanlab Studio automatically runs the data quality algorithms from this library on top of AutoML models fit to your data, and presents detected issues in a smart data editing interface. Think of it like a data cleaning assistant that helps you quickly improve the quality of your data (via AI/automation + streamlined UX). [Try it for free!](https://cleanlab.ai/signup/) \n",
