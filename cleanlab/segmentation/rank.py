    """Returns a label quality score for each image.

    This is a function to compute label quality scores for semantic segmentation datasets,
    where lower scores indicate labels less likely to be correct.

    * N - Number of images in the dataset
    * K - Number of classes in the dataset
    * H - Height of each image
    * W - Width of each image

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels:
      A discrete array of noisy labels for a segmantic segmentation dataset, in the shape ``(N,H,W,)``,
      where each pixel must be integer in 0, 1, ..., K-1.
      Refer to documentation for this argument in :py:func:`find_label_issues <cleanlab.segmentation.filter.find_label_issues>` for further details.

    pred_probs:
      An array of shape ``(N,K,H,W,)`` of model-predicted class probabilities.
      Refer to documentation for this argument in :py:func:`find_label_issues <cleanlab.segmentation.filter.find_label_issues>` for further details.

    method: {"softmin", "num_pixel_issues"}, default="softmin"
      Label quality scoring method.

      - "softmin" - Calculates the inner product between scores and softmax(1-scores). For efficiency, use instead of "num_pixel_issues".
      - "num_pixel_issues" - Uses the number of pixels with label issues for each image using :py:func:`find_label_issues <cleanlab.segmentation.filter.find_label_issues>`

    batch_size :
      Optional size of mini-batches to use for estimating the label issues for 'num_pixel_issues' only, not 'softmin'.
      To maximize efficiency, try to use the largest `batch_size` your memory allows. If not provided, a good default is used.

    n_jobs:
      Optional number of processes for multiprocessing (default value = 1). Only used on Linux. For 'num_pixel_issues' only, not 'softmin'
      If `n_jobs=None`, will use either the number of: physical cores if psutil is installed, or logical cores otherwise.

    verbose:
      Set to ``False`` to suppress all print statements.

    **kwargs:
      * downsample : int,
          Factor to shrink labels and pred_probs by for 'num_pixel_issues' only, not 'softmin' . Default ``16``
          Must be a factor divisible by both the labels and the pred_probs. Larger values of `downsample` produce faster runtimes but potentially less accurate results due to over-compression. Set to 1 to avoid any downsampling.
      * temperature : float,
          Temperature for softmin. Default ``0.1``


    Returns
    -------
    image_scores:
        Array of shape ``(N, )`` of scores between 0 and 1, one per image in the dataset.
        Lower scores indicate image more likely to contain a label issue.
    pixel_scores:
        Array of shape ``(N,H,W)`` of scores between 0 and 1, one per pixel in the dataset.

def issues_from_scores(

) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Converts scores output by `~cleanlab.segmentation.rank.get_label_quality_scores`
    to a list of issues of similar format as output by :py:func:`segmentation.filter.find_label_issues <cleanlab.segmentation.filter.find_label_issues>`.

    Only considers as issues those tokens with label quality score lower than `threshold`,
    so this parameter determines the number of issues that are returned.

    Note
    ----
    - This method is intended for converting the most severely mislabeled examples into a format compatible with ``summary`` methods like :py:func:`segmentation.summary.display_issues <cleanlab.segmentation.summary.display_issues>`.
    - This method does not estimate the number of label errors since the `threshold` is arbitrary, for that instead use :py:func:`segmentation.filter.find_label_issues <cleanlab.segmentation.filter.find_label_issues>`, which estimates the label errors via Confident Learning rather than score thresholding.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_scores:
      Array of shape `(N, )` of overall image scores, where `N` is the number of images in the dataset.
      Same format as the `image_scores` returned by `~cleanlab.segmentation.rank.get_label_quality_scores`.

    pixel_scores:
      Optional array of shape ``(N,H,W)`` of scores between 0 and 1, one per pixel in the dataset.
      Same format as the `pixel_scores` returned by `~cleanlab.segmentation.rank.get_label_quality_scores`.

    threshold:
        Optional quality scores threshold that determines which pixels are included in result. Pixels with with quality scores above the `threshold` are not
        included in the result. If not provided, all pixels are included in result.

    Returns
    ---------
    issues:
      Returns a boolean **mask** for the entire dataset
      where ``True`` represents a pixel label issue and ``False`` represents an example that is
      accurately labeled with using the threshold provided by the user.
      Use :py:func:`segmentation.summary.display_issues <cleanlab.segmentation.summary.display_issues>`
      to view these issues within the original images.

      If `pixel_scores` is not provided, returns array of integer indices (rather than boolean mask) of the images whose label quality score
      falls below the `threshold` (sorted by overall label quality score of each image).

    """
    Input pixel scores and get label quality score for that image, currently using the "softmin" method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pixel_scores:
        Per-pixel label quality scores in flattened array of shape ``(N, )``, where N is the number of pixels in the image.

    method: default "softmin"
        Method to use to calculate the image's label quality score.
        Currently only supports "softmin".
    temperature: default 0.1
        Temperature of the softmax function. Too small values may cause numerical underflow and NaN scores.

        Lower values encourage this method to converge toward the label quality score of the pixel with the lowest quality label in the image.

        Higher values encourage this method to converge toward the average label quality score of all pixels in the image.

    Returns
    ---------
    image_score:
        Float of the image's label quality score from 0 to 1, 0 being the lowest quality and 1 being the highest quality.
