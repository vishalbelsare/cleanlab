    Display token classification label issues, showing sentence with problematic token(s) highlighted.

    Can also shows given and predicted label for each token identified to have label issue.

    Parameters
    ----------
    issues:
        List of tuples ``(i, j)`` representing a label issue for the `j`-th token of the `i`-th sentence.

        Same format as output by :py:func:`token_classification.filter.find_label_issues <cleanlab.token_classification.filter.find_label_issues>`
        or :py:func:`token_classification.rank.issues_from_scores <cleanlab.token_classification.rank.issues_from_scores>`.

    tokens:
        Nested list such that `tokens[i]` is a list of tokens (strings/words) that comprise the `i`-th sentence.

    labels:
        Optional nested list of given labels for all tokens, such that `labels[i]` is a list of labels, one for each token in the `i`-th sentence.
        For a dataset with K classes, each label must be in 0, 1, ..., K-1.

        If `labels` is provided, this function also displays given label of the token identified with issue.

    pred_probs:
        Optional list of np arrays, such that `pred_probs[i]` has shape ``(T, K)`` if the `i`-th sentence contains T tokens.

        Each row of `pred_probs[i]` corresponds to a token `t` in the `i`-th sentence,
        and contains model-predicted probabilities that `t` belongs to each of the K possible classes.

        Columns of each `pred_probs[i]` should be ordered such that the probabilities correspond to class 0, 1, ..., K-1.

        If `pred_probs` is provided, this function also displays predicted label of the token identified with issue.

    exclude:
        Optional list of given/predicted label swaps (tuples) to be ignored. For example, if `exclude=[(0, 1), (1, 0)]`,
        tokens whose label was likely swapped between class 0 and 1 are not displayed. Class labels must be in 0, 1, ..., K-1.

    class_names:
        Optional length K list of names of each class, such that `class_names[i]` is the string name of the class corresponding to `labels` with value `i`.

        If `class_names` is provided, display these string names for predicted and given labels, otherwise display the integer index of classes.

    top: int, default=20
        Maximum number of issues to be printed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    issues:
        List of tuples ``(i, j)`` representing a label issue for the `j`-th token of the `i`-th sentence.

    labels:

    Returns
    -------
    df:
        If both `labels` and `pred_probs` are provided, DataFrame `df` contains columns ``['token', 'given_label',
        'predicted_label', 'num_label_issues']``, and each row contains information for a specific token and
